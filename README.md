### Project Overview
```
The primary goal of this project is to clean and structure a raw data set using Excel for initial organization, perform data summarization and insights using pivot tables, and conduct advanced querying for analysis using SQL. The cleaned dataset, summarized in Excel using some Excel functions including conditional functions; and pivot tables and further analyzed with SQL queries, provides insights into trends, patterns, and outliers. The project delivers actionable recommendations based on the analysis to assist in data-driven decision-making.

### Data Sources

### Data Cleaning and Preparations
```
In the initial phase of the Data cleaning and preparations, we perform the following actions;
1. Data loading and Inspection
2. Handling missing variables 
3. Data Cleaning and formatting


### Data Analysis
```
This is where we include some basic lines of code or queries or even some of the DAX expressions used during your analysis;

```SQL
